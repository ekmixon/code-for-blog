Code to accompany the "Plugins in C" article in my blog. Comes with a Makefile
for Linux (tested with gcc 4.6 on Ubuntu 12.04, and later also with gcc 9.3 on
Ubuntu 20.04), though it should be easy to adapt to other Unix and Linux
systems.

After building with "make", run "htmlize_main < sampletext.txt"
