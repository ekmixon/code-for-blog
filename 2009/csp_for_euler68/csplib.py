class CSP(object):
    """ A finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problem.
        Specified by the following:
        
        vars:   
            A list of variables (ints or strings)
        domains:
            A dict holding for each var a list of its possible
            values.
        neighbors: 
            A dict holding for each var a list of the other 
            variables that participate in constraints with this
            var.
        binary_constraint:
            A function func(A, a, B, b) that returns True iff 
            neighbors A, B satisfy the constraint when they have
            values A=a, B=b.
        global_constraint:
            A function func(new_asgn, cur_asgn) that returns 
            True iff the var=val in new_asgn (a dict of var=val)
            conflict with the current assignment.
        
        The solution of a CSP is an 'assignment' - a dictionary
        mapping a variable to a value.
        
        Usage:
        
        Create a new CSP and then call a 'solve' method.
        
        Public interface:
        
        solve_search(init_assign=False, mcv=False, lcv=False):
            Solve the CSP using backtracking search with forward
            checking constraint propagation. 'init_assign' is
            an initial assignment from which the search starts 
            running (useful for problems like Sudoku).
            
            'mcv' turns the most constrained variable heuristic on
            'lcv' turns the least constraining value heuristic on
            
            Returns an assignment if one can be found, None 
            otherwise.
        
        check_consistency(assignment):
            Check that the given assignment is consistend (i.e.
            has no internal conflicts) in this CSP.
        
        to_str(assignment):
            Sub-classes may reimplement this to convert a solved
            CSP into a string.
        
        Attributes:
        
        nassigns:
            Statistical measure of the amount of assignments made
            during the search.
        
        loglevel:
            Set to enable logging printouts.
